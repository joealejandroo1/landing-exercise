                <p>Innovation isn’t always obvious to the eye, but look a little closer at Apple Plug. You’ll find it is designed to fit seamlessly into the outdated headphone connector, transforming last year’s phone into a modern masterpiece as beautifully as you’d expect from Apple. Once in place, Apple Plug cannot be removed. But why would you want to? Would you want to downgrade? We didn’t think so.</p>

                <p>Innovation questions everything you know. We removed the floppy drive, and people said we were wrong. We weren’t. We removed the CD drive, and again people said we were wrong. We weren’t. We never are. Apple Plug isn’t just a pristine product. It’s an essential part of showing others who you are.</p>
